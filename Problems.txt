Methods
24. Define two methods to print the maximum and the minimum number respectively among three numbers entered by user. 

25. Write a program with a method named getTotal that accepts two integers as  user input and Print its sum. 
Call this method from main( ) and print the results.

25. A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. 
For example, the number 5 is prime because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and 5. 
The number 8, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Write a method named isPrime, which takes an integer as  user input and Prints true
if the input is a prime number, or false otherwise. 

26. Write a value-Printing method, isVowel that prints the value true if a given character is a vowel, and otherwise print false. 

27. In main(), call a method that accept a string from user and count number of vowels in that string.
print the No of vowels.

81-90          AB
71-80          BB
61-70          BC
51-60          CD
41-50          DD
<=40          Fail


29. Define a method that returns the product of two numbers entered by user & that should be passed as arguments to the method.\
