//	Each Java primitive has a corresponding wrapper:

//boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double 
//Boolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double
	
	
//	 Autoboxing
//	 The automatic conversion of primitive types to the 
//	 object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.
//	 For example – conversion of int to Integer, 
//	 long to Long, double to Double, etc. 
	
//	Unboxing
//	It is just the reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an 
//	object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. 
//	For example – conversion of Integer to int, Long to long, Double to double, etc.
